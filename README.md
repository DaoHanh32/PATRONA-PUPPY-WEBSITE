# PATRONA-PUPPY-WEBSITE
 My first project
 The PATRONA puppy website is a dog’s encyclopedia website. This is the idea of a very Famous Veteran - Ms. Patrona who is fond of animals specially Dogs, Cats, Rabbits. During her serving, along with her successful career, she also had strong passion on writing books on animals and their behavior. 

During those years, she had come across various type of breeds, their characteristics and behavior. With the intense interest for photography, she has a huge image gallery of the species she has discovered. Therefore, Ms. Patrona would like to share this collection to all and dog website is the first step in her plan.

This Website on Dog will help people understand more about dogs by showing all the type of dogs that Patrona discovered with more detail about location, their behavior, characteristic, etc.
